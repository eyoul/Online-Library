# DUMMIES-LIBRARY
## Student Centred Academic Book Access 


## The Context
This project is our Portfolio Project, concluding our Foundations Year at ALX-Holberton School. We pitched an idea about different projects and came up to this for our final three weeks of project in our foundation courses.

## What is Dummies-Library?
This is a digital library tailored for students at school which is simple that anyone can use without any concerns. It is called Dummies-Library. It helps to register users and enable them to access different academic books and related materials. It is simpler and easy to access for use from students, staff-members and administrator perspective. 

## What does Dummies-Library do?

- Registers student members
- Academic books and related materials upload
- Access the uploaded materials by the students
- Staff members to customize reading materials 
- Admins to control the system
- ✨Magic ✨

## Features

- Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
- Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
- Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
- Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
- Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

## Tech
**Programming languages used:**

- [HTML] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Javascript] - dynamic and interactive web content like applications and browsers
- [Django] - Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- [Phyton] - evented I/O for the backend
- [CSS] - how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
- [SQLite] - SQL database engine


## Challenges
- The project aims to assist students to access easily class materials books and related materials which is hard to find in hard copy.
- One problem that the project can’t solve is the ability to customize to specific clients. Additionally, it has less interactive contents.
- The project is mainly aiming to help students in grade-school at all classes.
- The project can be used and accessed by any person Ethiopian students in any corner of the country as far as there is internet access.

# Risks
## Technical Risks:
- Choosing specific framework and language for ease of access of the project members has been a debate. However, we chose based on learning curve time for new concepts, flexibility and ease to use to deliver our needed product.
- Implementing concepts of integration and deployment for this project. We have managed to find materials that will assist us in dilemmas concerning such encounters.

## Non-Technical Risks:
- There was difficulty encountered with synchronization of schedule and time for delivering the project towards its ultimatum. 
- Also, medium of communication while doing the project was at remote. For such, we solved the above problems doing our best to meet the standards if we were to do it in ideal setup: meeting via google meet, arranging project members available time and needs.

# Infrastructure
## Merge and Branch
- Primary features will have one branch, and one project member will be responsible for managing and merging to main branch.

## Strategy for deployment
- Initially, when reaching Minimum Viable Product (MVP), we will deploy the first version.
- Everytime when there is upgrade, we will rectify.

## Populate your app for data
- Seeding scripts to populate initial data set of data.

## Existing Solution
- There are many library digital systems where similar concepts are implemented. However, we brought the idea of digital library tailored for school students. The system allows them to have grade books, teacher notes and related materials. This is the brand of this project where it is unique from others in which school students are helped with the system to specific population group. For such, it elevates quality education and reduces burden of paper-based education system.
